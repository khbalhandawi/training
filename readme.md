# Training material on Isight, deep learning, and data engineering

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of training materials focused on three main areas:
  
- [**ISIGHT Tutorials:**](isight_python_tutorial/readme.md) Step-by-step guides on setting up Python environments, interfacing Python scripts with ISIGHT, and automating workflows.
- [**Deep Learning Notebooks:**](deep_learning_tutorial/deep_learning.ipynb) Introductory notebooks that cover the basic concepts of deep learning, provide an overview of neural network architectures, and demonstrate practical examples.
- **Data Engineering Resources:** Materials and scripts that demonstrate best practices and tools for managing and processing data in various environments.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a comprehensive resource for learners and professionals who want to:
  
- Gain hands-on experience in building and deploying Python scripts in an engineering context.
- Learn the fundamentals of deep learning and machine learning through practical, annotated examples.
- Understand data engineering workflows and how to integrate them with modeling and simulation tools like Isight.

By exploring these materials, users will be equipped with the skills necessary to bridge the gap between data analysis, model development, and application deployment in real-world projects.
